Secnidazole and other 5-nitroimidazole drugs enter micro-organisms by passive diffusion and undergo activation by reduction of the 5-nitro group. In anaerobic micro-organisms, such as Trichomonas, Giardia and Entamoeba spp., this intracellular reduction occurs via the pyruvateferredoxin oxidoreductase complex and results in a concentration gradient across the cell membrane which, in tum, enhances transport of the parent drug into the cell. Because the electron affinity of the 5-nitroimidazoles is greater than that of reduced ferredoxin, the drug interrupts the normal electron flow. Aerobic micro-organisms have a more positive redox potential (i.e. are more efficient electron acceptors) than secnidazole and other 5-nitroimidazoles, which explains the selective toxicity of these drugs against anaerobic microorganisms. DNA is the intracellular target of the Secnidazole and other 5-nitroimidazoles. Secnidazole and other 5-nitroimidazoles possess selective activity against many anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and protozoa. In general, secnidazole and metronidazole were approximately equipotent in activity against Bacteroides fragilis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica, in in vitro studies. Secnidazole is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration. Plasma drug concentrations are linear over the therapeutic dose range of 0.5 to 2g. The tolerability profile of secnidazole does not differ markedly from other 5-nitroimidazoles. The most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials involved the gastrointestinal tract (nausea, vomiting, glossitis, anorexia, epigastric pain and a metallic taste) and occurred in 2 to 10% of patients.

Benznidazole is a nitroimidazole antiparasitic with good activity against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, commonly referred to as Chagas disease. Like other nitroimidazoles, benznidazole's main mechanism of action is to generate radical species which can damage the parasite's DNA or cellular machinery. Under anaerobic conditions, the nitro group of nitroimidazoles is believed to be reduced by the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase complex to create a reactive nitro radical species. The nitro radical can then either engage in other redox reactions directly or spontaneously give rise to a nitrite ion and imidazole radical instead. In mammals, the principal mediators of electron transport are NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH, which have a more positive reduction potential and so will not reduce nitroimidazoles to the radical form. This limits the spectrum of activity of nitroimidazoles so that host cells and DNA are not also damaged. This mechanism has been well-established for 5-nitroimidazoles such as metronidazole, but it is unclear if the same mechanism can be expanded to 2-nitroimidazoles (including benznidazole). In the presence of oxygen, by contrast, any radical nitro compounds produced will be rapidly oxidized by molecular oxygen, yielding the original nitroimidazole compound and a superoxide anion in a process known as ""futile cycling"". In these cases, the generation of superoxide is believed to give rise to other reactive oxygen species. The degree of toxicity or mutagenicity produced by these oxygen radicals depends on cells' ability to detoxify superoxide radicals and other reactive oxygen species. In mammals, these radicals can be converted safely to hydrogen peroxide, meaning benznidazole has very limited direct toxicity to human cells. In Trypanosoma species, however, there is a reduced capacity to detoxify these radicals, which results in damage to the parasite's cellular machinery. Benznidazole has a significant activity during the acute phase of Chagas disease, with a therapeutical success rate up to 80%. Its curative capabilities during the chronic phase are, however, limited. Some studies have found parasitologic cure (a complete elimination of T. cruzi from the body) in pediatric and young patients during the early stage of the chronic phase, but overall failure rate in chronically infected individuals is typically above 80%. However, some studies indicate treatment with benznidazole during the chronic phase, even if incapable of producing parasitologic cure, because it reduces electrocardiographic changes and a delays worsening of the clinical condition of the patient. Side effects tend to be common and occur more frequently with increased age. The most common adverse reactions associated with benznidazole are allergic dermatitis and peripheral neuropathy. It is reported that up to 30% of people will experience dermatitis when starting treatment. Benznidazole may cause photosensitization of the skin, resulting in rashes. Rashes usually appear within the first 2 weeks of treatment and resolve over time. In rare instances, skin hypersensitivity can result in exfoliative skin eruptions, edema, and fever. Peripheral neuropathy may occur later on in the treatment course and is dose dependent. Other adverse reactions include anorexia, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, and dysguesia, and bone marrow suppression. Gastrointestinal symptoms usually occur during the initial stages of treatment and resolves over time. Bone marrow suppression has been linked to the cumulative dose exposure.",,Pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase,"ANTIPARASITIC PRODUCTS, INSECTICIDES AND REPELLENTS",ClinicalTrials.gov|HTS amenable drugs|INN|KEGG|NPC informatics|NPC screening|Tariff|WHO essential,US Approved Rx

PAH is a relatively rare disease with usually a poor prognosis requiring more treatment options to prolong long-term outcomes. Marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals under brand name Uptravi, selexipag and its active metabolite, ACT-333679 (MRE-269), act as agonists of the prostacyclin receptor to increase vasodilation in the pulmonary circulation and decrease elevated pressure in the blood vessels supplying blood to the lungs. Selexipag is a selective prostacyclin (IP, also called PGI2) receptor agonist. The key features of pulmonary arterial hypertension include a decrease in prostacyclin and prostacyclin synthase (enzyme that helps produce prostacyclin) in the lung. Prostacyclin is a potent vasodilator with anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-thrombotic effects; therefore, there is strong rationale for treatment with IP receptor agonists. Selexipag is chemically distinct as it is not PGI2 or a PGI2 analogue and has high selectivity for the IP receptor. It is metabolized by carboxylesterase 1 to yield an active metabolite (ACT-333679) that is approximately 37 times more potent than selexipag.

In gout patients, Lesinurad lowered serum uric acid levels and increased renal clearance and fractional excretion of uric acid. Following single and multiple oral doses of Lesinurad to gout patients, dose-dependent decreases in serum uric acid levels and increases in urinary uric acid excretion were observed. Lesinurad reduces serum uric acid levels by inhibiting the function of transporter proteins involved in uric acid reabsorption in the kidney. Lesinurad inhibited the function of two apical transporters responsible for uric acid reabsorption, uric acid transporter 1 (URAT1) and organic anion transporter 4 (OAT4), with IC50 values of 7.3 and 3.7 µM, respectively. URAT1 is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered uric acid from the renal tubular lumen. OAT4 is a uric acid transporter associated with diuretic-induced hyperuricemia. Lesinurad does not interact with the uric acid reabsorption transporter SLC2A9 (Glut9), located on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule cell. Based on in vitro studies, lesinurad is an inhibitor of OATP1B1, OCT1, OAT1, and OAT3; however, lesinurad is not an in vivo inhibitor of these transporters. In vivo drug interaction studies indicate that lesinurad does not decrease the renal clearance of furosemide (substrate of OAT1/3), or affect the exposure of atorvastatin (substrate of OATP1B1) or metformin (substrate of OCT1).

As a third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, osimertinib is specific for the gate-keeper T790M mutation which increases ATP binding activity to EGFR and results in poor prognosis for late-stage disease. Furthermore, osimertinib has been shown to spare wild-type EGFR during therapy, thereby reducing non-specific binding and limiting toxicity.

It has been approved in Switzerland and the US, in combination with vemurafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that Cobimetinib is effective in inhibiting the growth of tumor cells bearing a BRAF mutation, which has been found to be associated with many tumor types. A threonine-tyrosine kinase and a key component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signalling pathway that is frequently activated in human tumors, MEK1 is required for the transmission of growth-promoting signals from numerous receptor tyrosine kinases. Cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib because the clinical benefit of a BRAF inhibitor is limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Reactivation of the MAPK pathway is a major contributor to treatment failure in BRAF-mutant melanomas, approximately ~80% of melanoma tumors becomes BRAF-inhibitor resistant due to reactivation of MAPK signalling. BRAF-inhibitor resistant tumor cells are sensitive to MEK inhibition, therefore cobimetinib and vemurafenib will result in dual inhibition of BRAF and its downstream target, MEK. Cobimetinib specifically binds to and inhibits the catalytic activity of MEK1, resulting in inhibition of extracellular signal-related kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphorylation and activation and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Cobimetinib and vemurafenib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Cobimetinib is used for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. Cobimetinib is used in combination with vemurafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.

The approval was accelerated based on progression-free survival, therefore confirmatory trials by the sponsor to demonstrate clinical efficacy in multiple myeloma treatment are in progress of being conducted. Panobinostat is marketed by Novartis under the brand name Farydak. Panobinostat is a deacetylase (DAC) inhibitor. DACs, also known as histone DACs (HDAC), are responsible for regulating the acetylation of about 1750 proteins in the body; their functions are involved in many biological processes including DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodelling, transcription of genes, progression of the cell-cycle, protein degradation and cytoskeletal reorganization. In multiple myeloma, there is an overexpression of DAC proteins. Panobinostat inhibits class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8), class II (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) and class IV (HDAC 11) proteins. Panobinostat's antitumor activity is believed to be attributed to epigenetic modulation of gene expression and inhibition of protein metabolism.

Lenvatinib also inhibits other RTKs that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) located in the cell membrane play a central role in the activation of signal transduction pathways involved in the normal regulation of cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation, and in pathogenic angiogenesis, lymphogenesis, tumour growth and cancer progression. In particular, VEGF has been identified as a crucial regulator of both physiologic and pathologic angiogenesis and increased expression of VEGF is associated with a poor prognosis in many types of cancers. Lenvatinib is indicated for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Most patients with thyroid cancer have a very good prognosis with treatment (98% 5 year survival rate) involving surgery and hormone therapy. However, for patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer, treatment options are limited and the prognosis is poor, leading to a push for the development of more targeted therapies such as lenvatinib.

Like other antifungal triazoles, efinaconazole inhibits the fungal cytochrome P450 enzyme lanosterol 14α demethylase (CYP51), thereby disrupting ergosterol synthesis and, consequently, membrane integrity and growth in fungi. CYP51 is evolutionarily conserved and, in mammals, mediates conversion of lanosterol to meiosis-activating sterols (MAS); MAS are intermediates in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and may have a signaling role in initiating meiosis and oocyte maturation. Azoles have higher affinity for fungal CYP51 compared to the mammalian enzyme and such selectivity contributes to the safety of this therapeutic class. Azoles have been reported to produce reproductive and developmental toxicity in both humans and laboratory animals.

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), expressed in the proximal renal tubules, is responsible for the majority of the reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen. Canagliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, canagliflozin reduces reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose (RTG), and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. In extensive clinical trials, canagliflozin produced a consistent dose-dependent reduction in HbA1c of 0.77% to 1.16% when administered as monotherapy, combination with metformin, combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea, combination with metformin and pioglitazone, and in combination with insulin from a baselines of 7.8% to 8.1%, in combination with metformin, or in combination with metformin and a sulfonylurea.

Gadoterate Meglumine is a gadolinium chelate paramagnetic contrast agent. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoterate meglumine produces a large magnetic moment and so a large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rate of nearby protons; as a result, the signal intensity of tissue images observed with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be enhanced. Because this agent is preferentially taken up by normal functioning hepatocytes, normal hepatic tissue is enhanced with MRI while tumor tissue is unenhanced.

Each molecule of trastuzumab emtansine consists of a single trastuzumab molecule with several molecules of DM1, a cytotoxic maytansinoid, attached. SMCC, or succinimidyl trans-4-(maleimidylmethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate, is a heterobifunctional crosslinker, a type of chemical reagent that contains two reactive functional groups, a succinimide ester and a maleimide. The succinimide group of SMCC reacts with the free amino group of a lysine residue in the trastuzumab molecule and the maleimide moiety of SMCC links to the free sulfhydryl group of DM1, forming a covalent bond between the antibody and the DM1. Each trastuzumab molecule may be linked to zero to eight DM1 molecules (3.5 on average). Trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate consisting of the recombinant anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) monoclonal antibody trastuzumab conjugated to the maytansinoid DM1. The trastuzumab moiety of this ADC binds to HER2 on tumor cell surface surfaces; upon internalization, the DM1 moiety is released and binds to tubulin, thereby disrupting microtubule assembly/disassembly dynamics and inhibiting cell division and the proliferation of cancer cells that overexpress HER2. Linkage of antibody and drug through a nonreducible linker has been reported to contribute to the improved efficacy and reduced toxicity of this ADC compared to similar ADCs constructed with reducible linkers. Trastuzumab emtansine is used for the treatment of patients with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer who previously received rastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either: received prior therapy for metastatic disease, or developed disease recurrence during or within six months of completing adjuvant therapy.

Although the mechanism of action through which perampanel exerts its antiepileptic effect has not been fully elucidated, this agent antagonizes the AMPA subtype of the excitatory glutamate receptor found on postsynaptic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). This antagonistic action prevents AMPA receptor activation by glutamate and results in the inhibition of neuronal excitation, repetitive neuronal firing, and the stabilization of hyper-excited neural membranes. Glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, plays an important role in various neurological disorders caused by neuronal hyperexcitation. The drug is currently approved, for the control of partial-onset seizures, in those of both sexes who suffer from epilepsy and who are 12 years of age and older, by the Food and Drug Administration.

Activation of GC-C by linaclotide results in the intra- and extracellular increase of cyclic guanosine monophosphate concentrations (cGMP).

The metabolite of linaclotide MM-419447 (CCEYCCNPACTGC) contributes to the pharmacologic effects of linaclotide. Ultimately, linaclotide helps patients with IBS (especially with constipation) as GI transit is accelerated and the release of intestinal fluid is increased. In animal models, a decrease in visceral pain after administration of linaclotide may be observed.

It was shown in several randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies that applied topically for 2 to 3 days ingenol mebutate gel is effective for treatment of actinic keratoses. The mechanism of action by which Picato gel induces cell death in treating AK lesions is unknown.

Leucovorin, folates and folate antimetabolites are substrates of glucarpidase. It is not recommended to use leucovorin within 2 hours before or after a dose of Voraxaze. Adverse effects that have been reported have been mild and include numbness, tingling, flushing, nausea, vomiting, itching, and headache",,Methotrexate,VARIOUS,Approved drugs|Biologics|EMA orphan|Human approved drugs|NPC informatics,US Approved Rx
